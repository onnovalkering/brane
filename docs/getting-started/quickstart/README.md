description: Learn the basics of the Brane framework.

# Quickstart

In this quickstart you will learn how to add functionalities to a Brane instance, and how to use them as building blocks for data processing pipelines. You'll learn this while implementing a simple word count application. This basic example application retreives the README.md file from some GitHub repository and, if a certain word count threshold is met, creates a word cloud image from this README.md file.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This quickstart assumes a complete [installation](../installation.md): CLI, Brane instance, and IDE.
{% endhint %}
