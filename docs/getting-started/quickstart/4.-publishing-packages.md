# 4. Publishing packages

Currently, the two packages are only available locally. To use them as part of a Brane instance, we have to publish them to the registry that is part of the Brane instance. For this we can use the Brane CLI (Fig. 1):

```
$ brane push github 1.0.0
$ brane push base64 1.0.0
```

There are more commands available to work with packages and the registry, review them as follows:

```
$ brane help
```
